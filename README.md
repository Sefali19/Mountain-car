## Description

The Mountain Car problem is a classic reinforcement learning task where an underpowered car must drive up a steep hill. This implementation uses Q-learning with state discretization to learn a policy for solving the problem.

Key features:
- Q-learning implementation for the Mountain Car environment
- State space discretization
- Epsilon-greedy action selection
- Visualization of the learned value function
- Option to run multiple episodes and aggregate results

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenAI Gym
